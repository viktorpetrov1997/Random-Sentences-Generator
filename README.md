# Random Sentences Generator
### Project Goals
The goal of the project is to create a console application that generates random sentences.
### Solution
To create our sentences we are going to need: names, places, verbs, nouns, adverbs and details. The sentence that we will create is based on the following model:

One sentence needs [Who from where] [Action] [Detail] to be created.
- "Who from where" example: [Name + from + Place] ("David from London").
- "Action" example: [Adverb] + [Verb] + [Noun] ("calmly watched the sunset").
- "Detail" example: "near the river", "at home", "in the park

We store all names, places, verbs, nouns, adverbs and details and generate a differenct combination of them to create a sentence.
